#Solution So Far..

This is an archive (zip file) of a solution to the lab so far:

- <https://github.com/wit-web-dev-2016/app-store/releases/tag/lab.1.end>

## 1: Index.html

Just to get used to the editor, create a few more new apps in the 'apps.html', perhaps you can locate content from some web source (including images). Try to identify and replicate the way the code is indented in the existing content.

## 2: New pages

Incorporate content into a new `directions.html` page. It can contain any content you think would be useful. Incorporate some links in each page so you can move around in the site from page to page.


## 3: Link the CSS file to all pages

Currently you may not have the CSS file 'linked' to app.html or the `directions.html` page. i.e. only index.html is styled with the css rules you have defined. See if you can link the other pages now.


## 4: HTML Reference

If you are finding initial contact with HTML a little challenging - this is an excellent starter resource to review:

It is short read.

## 5: Lists

In this lab you used the element `<ul`>
Investigate the use of `<ol`> , find out the differences between these elements here:
