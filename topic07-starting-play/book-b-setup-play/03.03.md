#Create a Play Project

Back in the command line, change to a directory where you keep your web development projects and enter:

~~~
play new playdemo
~~~


You should get:

~~~

~
~ play! 1.5.0, http://www.playframework.org
~
~ The new application will be created in c:\course-work\web-development\lab07\playdemo
~ What is the application name? [playdemo] 
~~~

Press return when prompted for the name to accept the default (playdemo)

~~~
~
~ OK, the application is created.
~ Start it with : play run playdemo
~ Have fun!
~
~~~

Explore the generated folder - called 'playdemo'. It should contain these folders:

- app
- conf
- documentation
- lib
- modules
- public
- test

Explore the contents of the `app`,  '`conf' and `public` folders. Use Sublime to this this (for the moment).
