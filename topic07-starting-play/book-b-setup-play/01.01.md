# Install Git

Install git for your platform:

- <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>

Accept all the default options if they are presented (usually it is just Windows that offers options).

If the installation succeeded, then verify the version. Do this by opening a shell (command prompt on Windows) and enter the following:

~~~
git --version
~~~

The system might respond with something like this:

~~~
git version 2.16.1.windows.4
~~~
