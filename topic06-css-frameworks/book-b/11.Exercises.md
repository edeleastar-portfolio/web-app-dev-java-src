This is an archive of the completed project:

## Exercise 1

This site has been built as a static site - without using template. To gain further practice in templating, consider refactoring the site to use the EJS templating.

## Exercise 2

Investigate this framework here:

In many ways this is a lighter and more flexible framework than Semantic-UI. Its documentation clear, concise - and similar in structure to the Semantic UI documents:

- <https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction>

Additionally, the `kitchen sink` type demo:

- <https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/index.html>

would enable you to very quickly get an overview of its capabilities and features. Note that on the top of that page you can select any of the components to see them in action.
