# Setup.

We need 2 free services to get our Play Application live in the Cloud. In this step we create the necessary accounts.

- Heroku
- Dropbox

## (1) Heroku

Visit this site:

- <https://www.heroku.com>

And sign up for a new account.

Once confirmed, log in and go you your Dashboard:

- <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps>

This is a Platform as a Service provided (PaaS), you can read about PaaS here:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service>

We will be using this service to get our Play Applications Live.


## (2) Dropbox

If you do not already have one, create and account here:

- <https://www.dropbox.com/>

You will then need to download the Dropbox Application, which will be a native application installed on your computer:

 - <https://www.dropbox.com/install>

When this is installed, a folder called `Dropbox` will be created on your workstation - which will also be mirrored in the cloud. Make sure you can locate this folder and that it is in fact synced with the cloud.
