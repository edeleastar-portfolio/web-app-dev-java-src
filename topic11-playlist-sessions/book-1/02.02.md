# Review the Static Routes + Controllers

In order to refresh our understanding of how the application works, start by looking at the routes file:

## conf/routes

~~~java
GET     /                                       Start.index
GET     /dashboard                              Dashboard.index
GET     /dashboard/deleteplaylist/{id}          Dashboard.deletePlaylist
POST    /dasghboard/addplaylist                 Dashboard.addPlaylist

GET     /playlists/{id}                         PlaylistCtrl.index
GET     /playlists/{id}/deletesong/{songid}     PlaylistCtrl.deleteSong
POST    /playlists/{id}/addsong                 PlaylistCtrl.addSong

GET     /about                                  About.index
GET     /admin                                  Admin.index
~~~

Each of these represents a link that the application can serve. These links are in the various views our application presents.

## Landing Page

This is the route for the entire application
~~~
GET     /                                       Start.index
~~~

it will render the start page:

This is the controller method:

## app/controllers/start.java

~~~
  public static void index() {
    Logger.info("Rendering Start");
    render ("start.html");
  }
~~~

... and this is the start view:

## views/start.html

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Start' /}

#{menu id:"start"/}

<section class="ui center aligned middle aligned segment">
  <h1 class="ui header">
    Welcome to Playlist 1
  </h1> 
  <p>
    A small app to let you compose playlists. This app will allow you to create, manage and share your playlists. Simple enter the playlist details one the dashboard.
  </p>
</section>
~~~

## Exercise

Carry our the above inspection for the following routes:

~~~
GET     /dashboard                              Dashboard.index
GET     /about                                  About.index
GET     /admin                                  Admin.index
~~~

I.e. Examine the controller + the associated view. Perhaps put them into a single text file using sublime so you can look at each controller method + view to get familiar with the lifecycle, response composition and rendered page.
