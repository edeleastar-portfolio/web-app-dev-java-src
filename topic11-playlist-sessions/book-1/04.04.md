# Review POST Routes


The final routes of interest are the POST routes:

~~~
POST    /dasghboard/addplaylist                 Dashboard.addPlaylist
POST    /playlists/{id}/addsong                 PlaylistCtrl.addSong
~~~

POST is always used in the context of a from - and the above support forms for creating playlists or songs.

Looking at this one in more detail:

~~~
POST    /dasghboard/addplaylist                 Dashboard.addPlaylist
~~~

This route is associated with this form:

## views/tags/addplaylist.html

~~~
<form class="ui stacked segment form" action="/dashboard/addplaylist" method="POST">
  <div class="field">
    <label>Title</label>
    <input placeholder="Title" type="text" name="title">
  </div>
  <button class="ui blue submit button">Add Playlist</button>
</form>
~~~

.. and this controller method:

~~~
  public static void addPlaylist (String title)
  {
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist (title, 0);
    Logger.info ("Adding a new playlist called " + title);
    playlist.save();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }
~~~

When the method completes, it just triggers the dashboard route again:

~~~
  public static void index() 
  {
    Logger.info("Rendering Admin");
    List<Playlist> playlists = Playlist.findAll();
    render ("dashboard.html", playlists);
  }
~~~

This will display the list of playlists - this time the database query will return one less.

## Exercise

Inspect this route in detail:

~~~
POST    /playlists/{id}/addsong                 PlaylistCtrl.addSong
~~~

Locating:

- the view from which it is triggered
- the form that matched the route
- the controller method that is invoked
- the response that is generated
