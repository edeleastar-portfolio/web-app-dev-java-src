##Exercise

This is the completed app store project from lab03a:

- [lab03a](./archives/lab03a/index.html)
- [lab03.zip](./archives/lab03a.zip)

We now want to apply the navigation tabs to the app store. Specifically, add a set of tabs for home, deals and about that is positioned just above the main heading.

Work through the steps needed to 

- Add the menu section in your html files
- Name the class and id's correctly
- Add the css rules
- Test to make sure your menu works.

Notice that the tabs in the above look a little different from our completed lab04a project. Here is an alternative to the completed lab04a project:

Notice the different style applied to the tabs? See you can apply this style to the lab03a project.
