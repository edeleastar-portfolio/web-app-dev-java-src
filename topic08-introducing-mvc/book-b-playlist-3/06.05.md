# Deleting Songs 1

Having a playlist app, without the ability to create/delete songs or playlists is clearly very limited. We have, essentially, an app that allows us to `Read` our models, but not `Create`, `Update` or `Delete` elements of the model.

We can start with providing a facility to delete songs from individual playlists. Our view will need to look like this:

![](img/05.png)

and deleting a button should remove the corresponding song.

Any new button/link/action on our page requires:

- an element in a view
- a route matching the view element
- a matching controller function

.. and it may also involve some interaction with the model.

# View

The new button must appear in each song row. Here is a revised listsongs partial:

## app/views/tags/listsongs.html

~~~html
<table class="ui fixed table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}
      <tr>
        <td>
          ${song.title}
        </td>
        <td>
          ${song.artist}
        </td>
        <td>        
          ${song.duration}
        </td>      
         <td>
            <a href="/playlists/${_playlist.id}/deletesong/${song.id}" class="ui tiny red button">Delete Song</a>
          </td>         
      </tr>
    #{/list}
  </tbody>
</table>
~~~


# Route

A new route - containing both the playlist and song id - and linking to a new function in the playlist controller:

## conf/routes

~~~js
GET     /playlists/{id}/deletesong/{songid}     PlaylistCtrl.deleteSong
~~~

# Controller

This is a new function to handle this route:

## app/ontrollers/PlaylistCtrl.java

~~~js
...
  public static void deletesong (Long id, Long songid)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Song song = Song.findById(songid);
    Logger.info ("Removing" + song.title);

    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
...
~~~


Try all of this now - and verify that the logs shows the attempt to delete the song when the button is pressed.

We havent yet deleted the song - we will leave that to the next step.
