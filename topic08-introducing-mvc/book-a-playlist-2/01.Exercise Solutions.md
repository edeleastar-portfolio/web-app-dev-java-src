## Exercise 3: Add a new playlist

Extend your version of the app to contain a new playlist - make up some songs. Verify that they are rendered as expected.

## Solution

## app/controllers/Dashboard.java

~~~
    //...
    Song s7 = new Song ("Opus 34: Six variations on a theme in F major", "Beethoven");
    Song s8 = new Song ("Opus 120: Thirty-three variations on a waltz by Diabelli in C major", "Beethoven");
    Playlist p3 = new Playlist("Beethoven Variations");
    p3.songs.add (s7);
    p3.songs.add (s8);
    //...
    playlists.add(p3);
    //...
~~~

## Exercise 4: New Fields

Extend the playlist to have new entry called `duration`. Also, extend each song to also have a `duration` field + a `genre` field. Change the constructor to initialise these fields.

### app/models/song.java

~~~
package models;

public class Song
{
  public String title;
  public String artist;
  public int duration;
  
  public Song(String title, String artist, int duration)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.artist = artist;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
~~~

### app/models/playlist.java

~~~
package models;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Playlist
{
  public String title;
  public List<Song> songs = new ArrayList<Song>();
  public int duration;

  public Playlist(String title, int duration)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
~~~

app/controllers/Dashboard.java


~~~
    Song s1 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 3", "Beethoven", 5);
    Song s2 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 7", "Beethoven", 6);
    Song s3 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 10", "Beethoven",8 );
    Playlist p1 = new Playlist("Beethoven Sonatas", 19);
    p1.songs.add (s1);
    p1.songs.add (s2);
    p1.songs.add (s3);
    
    Song s4 = new Song("Piano Concerto No. 1", "Beethoven", 8);
    Song s5 = new Song("Piano Concerto No. 12", "Beethoven", 12);
    Song s6 = new Song("Piano Concerto No. 23", "Beethoven", 23);
    Playlist p2 = new Playlist("Beethoven Concertos", 43);
    p2.songs.add (s4);
    p2.songs.add (s5);
    p2.songs.add (s6);
    
    Song s7 = new Song ("Opus 34: Six variations on a theme in F major", "Beethoven", 12);
    Song s8 = new Song ("Opus 120: Thirty-three variations on a waltz by Diabelli in C major", "Beethoven", 14);
    Playlist p3 = new Playlist("Beethoven Variations", 26);
    p3.songs.add (s7);
    p3.songs.add (s8);

Modify the dashboard view to display these new fields.

## Exercise 5: Extend Views

### app/views/dashboard.html

~~~
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Dashboard' /}

#{menu id:"dashboard"/}

#{list items:playlists, as:'playlist'}
  <section class="ui segment">
    <h2 class="ui header">
      ${playlist.title} 
    </h2>
    Total Duration: ${playlist.duration}
    #{listsongs playlist:playlist/}
  </section>
#{/list}
~~~

### app/views/tags/listsongs.hbs

~~~
<table class="ui fixed table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}
      <tr>
        <td>
          ${song.title}
        </td>
        <td>
          ${song.artist}
        </td>
        <td>        
          ${song.duration}
        </td>        
      </tr>
    #{/list}
  </tbody>
</tabl

## app/views/about.html

~~~
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'About' /}

#{menu id:"about"/}
