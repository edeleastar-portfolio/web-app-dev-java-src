# Using Harp

Before entering the next few commands, make sure you know EXACTLY where your command prompt session is located in the folder structure. Perhaps you may be somewhere like:

- `C:\course-work\web-development\lab05a`

See the previous step for guidance on this. If you are evey confused as to which folder tour command promot is based in, just enter this command:

~~~
dir
~~~

This will list the `current` diretory contents.

## Using Harp

Once harp installed, then from the command prompt again, you will be able to carry out these commands :

~~~
harp init demo
~~~

This will respond with: 

~~~
