#Exercises

See if you can deploy one of your lab projects using surge. Here are the steps:

# 1: Verify harp & surge installed

Make sure you have the node+harp+surge packages installed on your computer. Open a command prompt and enter

~~~
node -v
harp -V
~~~

# 2: Prepare Project Folder

Create a new (empty) folder to contain your project. Into this folder place the following file:

## harp.json

~~~
{
  "globals": 
  {

  }
}
~~~

#3: Copy Project Files

Place your entire project into a folder called `public` inside this project folder (as we did in step 05).

#4: Run the Server

From the command line, enter the command:

~~~
harp server
~~~

#5: Verify Site

Verify that your side it available on:

    - <http://localhost:9000/>

#6: Publish Site

Terminate the server with ^C, and then enter:

~~~
surge
~~~

This will deploy the web site:

~~~
  project path: G:\dev\iot-web\
               size: 34 files, 2.3 MB
             domain: XXX.surge.sh
             upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s
   propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%
               plan: Free
              users: youremail@domain.com
         IP address: 192.241.214.148

    Success! Project is published and running at XXX.surge.sh
~~~

#7: Verify Deployment

Verify that the site is available on the domain. You will have the opportunity to change the domain `XXX`

#8 : Review Relative vs Absolute paths 

You may have had relative paths in your html files:

~~~
  <a href="../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

or even more confusing:

~~~
  <a href="../../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

These type of references can all be replaced with:

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

Try this now - one link at a time to make sure it works.
