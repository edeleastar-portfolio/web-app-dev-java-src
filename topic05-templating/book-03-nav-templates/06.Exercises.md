# Solution

This is a complete archive of the site created in this lab:

- [navdemofinal.zip](./archives/navdemo-final.zip)

## Exercise 1: Compile

Try the `harp compile` command from a shell inside the project folder. Explore the generated `www` folder. It should be a complete (non ejs) version of the site.


## Exercise 2: Publish

Publish the site using the surge service.

## Exercise 3: Add additional pages

Introduce pages V an VI. You might be interested, perhaps, in using a lorem upsum generator for the content:
